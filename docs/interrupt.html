<h1 id="what-is-an-interrupt">What is an Interrupt?</h1>
<p>Okay, this one is really easy, but we need to continue background to get to the crazy hacker linux stuff.</p>
<p>Like I said before about the program counter- the program counter usually just increments one by one, executing each line. Sometimes it jumps if an instruction tells it to.</p>
<p>An interrupt is a trigger- a voltage on a pin, a hardware timer, or some event, which causes the processor to save it's current program counter and other state information, and then jump automatically to a pre-set memory address and start executing the code there. When it's done with the interrupt, it goes back to where it was and continues as normal.</p>
<p>On the memory map, there a section called the NVIC, each of these addresses record an address of a function, and each address is associated with one type of interrupt. When that interrupt is triggered, the program counter jumps to that function.</p>
